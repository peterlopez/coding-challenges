Given an array of daily high temperatures for a city, produce a new array as output where each value is the number of days forward that has a temperature higher than this day. All of the temperature values are normal earth temperatures.

For example, if the daily highs are [50, 55, 53, 52, 60, 65, 63], then the result should be [ 1,  3,  2,  1,  1,  0,  0]. The last two values are special cases because there are no days in the future predicted to be hotter.
function daysToHigherTemp(dailyHighs) {
  /* your code here */
}
