This problem takes two arrays of points as input. Each entry in the queens array is an (x, y) pair on a chessboard where a queen is located. There are no other pieces on the board.

Each of the points in the positions array also an (x, y) of a square that is currently empty.

Return a new array of length equal to that of the positions array. Each entry is a boolean value that is true if that position is safe from attack.

Remember any of the queens can attack along vertical, horizontal, and diagonal directions and any number of spaces. The board is rectangular and is large enough for all of the queens and positions to be valid.
function arePositionsSafe(queens, positions) {
  /* your code here */
}
