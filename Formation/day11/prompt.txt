Given a binary tree, find the height, that is the length of the path from the root to the deepest leaf node.
/*
 * You may assume the node class is:
 * class TreeNode {
 *   constructor(value, left = null, right = null) {
 *     this.value = value;
 *     this.left = left;
 *     this.right = right;
 *   }
 * }
 */
function treeHeight(root) {
  /* your code here */
}
