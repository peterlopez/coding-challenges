Given a set of characters (guaranteed to be unique) and a minimum and maximum length, generate all possible passwords that meet the following criteria:
The same characters cannot appear consecutively
The same character can occur no more than twice in any password

The output should be an array containing the passwords as strings. Return an empty array if no valid password can be generated.
function generatePassword(characters, minlength, maxlength) {
  /* your code here */
}
